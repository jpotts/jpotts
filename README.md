### Howdy, folks ðŸ‘‹

I implement custom solutions for [Metaversant](https://www.metaversant.com) clients that usually involve content management, search, and workflow technology. I also write blog posts, tips, and tutorials at [ECM Architect](https://ecmarchitect.com). You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffpotts01) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffPotts). 

I am always looking for help with my various open source projects managed here, so feel free to log issues and create pull requests.
