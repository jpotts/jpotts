### Howdy, folks ðŸ‘‹

I used to implement custom solutions as part of my consulting company, [Metaversant](https://www.metaversant.com). Those solutions usually involved content management, search, and workflow technology. I've also written blog posts, tips, and tutorials at [ECM Architect](https://ecmarchitect.com) and a couple of books. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffpotts01) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffPotts). 

These days I work for Apple, and they've got pretty tight restrictions on what I can do with my open source projects, so feel free to log issues, create pull requests, and fork these projects to keep them moving forward without me for now.
